Introduction:
This is my attempt at improving the user experience by redesigning my very first project.
I started with observing how people navigated through the site with the old design using hotjar.
From there, I tried to make the design make more sense in Figma. I only redesigned the pages that got the most attention according to my hotjar recordings, and simply based the rest of my coded pages on that theme. I still kept some of the old elements, but improved them.

Because most of my hotjar recordings were from people using desktop, I made desktop my priority for this project.
I plan to make the website responsive on all surfaces in the future.

I also filmed/interviewed my boyfriend while he compared the old to the new site.
